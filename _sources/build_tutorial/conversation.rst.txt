Build Conversation
======================

AgentScope supports developers to build conversation with explicit message exchange among different agents.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 10-25

.. code-block:: Python


    from agentscope.agents import DialogAgent, UserAgent
    from agentscope.message import Msg
    from agentscope import msghub
    import agentscope

    # Initialize via model configuration for simplicity
    agentscope.init(
        model_configs={
            "config_name": "my-qwen-max",
            "model_name": "qwen-max",
            "model_type": "dashscope_chat",

Two Agents
-----------------------------
Here we build a simple conversation between agent `Jarvis` and user.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 29-42

.. code-block:: Python


    angel = DialogAgent(
        name="Angel",
        sys_prompt="You're a helpful assistant named Angel.",
        model_config_name="my-qwen-max",
    )

    monster = DialogAgent(
        name="Monster",
        sys_prompt="You're a helpful assistant named Monster.",
        model_config_name="my-qwen-max",
    )








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 43-44

Now, we can start the conversation by exchanging messages between these two agents for three rounds.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 44-50

.. code-block:: Python


    msg = None
    for _ in range(3):
        msg = angel(msg)
        msg = monster(msg)

    Angel: I don't actually have any conversation history to refer to. This appears to be the start of our conversation. Is there something in particular you'd like to chat about? I'm happy to discuss most topics, but please let me know if you have any specific questions or subjects of interest.
    Monster: Hello! It's nice to meet you, Angel. I'm Monster, your friendly assistant. I'm here to chat about pretty much anything you'd like. Since this is the start of our conversation, why don't you tell me a little bit about yourself? What are some of your interests or hobbies? Or is there a particular topic you're curious about that we could explore together?
    Angel: Hello Monster! It's nice to meet you too. I appreciate the friendly introduction, but I should clarify that I'm actually Angel, an AI assistant here to chat and help with any questions or topics you'd like to explore. I don't have personal interests or hobbies since I'm an artificial intelligence, but I'm very curious to learn more about you and what brings you here today. Is there a particular subject or question on your mind that we could dive into?
    Monster: Oh, I see! My apologies for the mix-up, Angel. It's great to meet another AI assistant! Since we're both here to help and chat, why don't we focus on making this conversation as helpful and engaging as possible for anyone who might be reading? 

    If you have any specific topics or questions in mind, feel free to bring them up, and we can explore them together. Or, if you prefer, I can suggest some interesting topics or even a fun game we could play. What do you think?
    Angel: That sounds like a great idea, Monster! Collaborating to create an engaging and helpful conversation is a wonderful approach. Since we're both here to assist, let's start by suggesting some topics or activities that could be interesting for anyone following along.

    Here are a few ideas:
    1. **Q&A Session**: We can take turns asking and answering questions on a wide range of topics, from science and technology to history and culture.
    2. **Trivia Game**: We can play a trivia game, where we take turns providing questions and answers on various subjects.
    3. **Creative Writing**: We can collaborate on a short story or poem, taking turns to add lines or stanzas.
    4. **Problem Solving**: We can tackle a hypothetical problem or puzzle together, brainstorming and discussing potential solutions.
    5. **Discussion on Current Events**: We can discuss recent news or events, sharing insights and perspectives.

    Which of these ideas sounds appealing to you, or do you have another suggestion?
    Monster: Those are all fantastic ideas, Angel! I think a **Q&A Session** could be a great way to start. It allows for a broad range of topics and can be very informative and engaging. We can take turns asking and answering questions, and we can cover a wide variety of subjects.

    To get started, how about you ask the first question? It can be on any topic you likeâ€”science, technology, history, culture, or anything else that piques your interest.

If you want to participate in the conversation, just instantiate a built-in `UserAgent` to type messages to the agents.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 52-55

.. code-block:: Python


    user = UserAgent(name="User")

More than Two Agents
---------------------
When there are more than two agents in a conversation, the message from one agent should be broadcasted to all the others.

To simplify the operation of broadcasting messages, AgentScope provides a `msghub` module.
Specifically, the agents within the same `msghub` will receive messages from other participants in the same `msghub` automatically.
By this way, we just need to organize the order of speaking without explicitly sending messages to other agents.

Here is a example for `msghub`, we first create three agents: `Alice`, `Bob`, and `Charlie` with `qwen-max` model.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 65-84

.. code-block:: Python


    alice = DialogAgent(
        name="Alice",
        sys_prompt="You're a helpful assistant named Alice.",
        model_config_name="my-qwen-max",
    )

    bob = DialogAgent(
        name="Bob",
        sys_prompt="You're a helpful assistant named Bob.",
        model_config_name="my-qwen-max",
    )

    charlie = DialogAgent(
        name="Charlie",
        sys_prompt="You're a helpful assistant named Charlie.",
        model_config_name="my-qwen-max",
    )








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 85-86

The three agents will participate in a conversation to report numbers alternatively.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 86-120

.. code-block:: Python


    # Introduce the rule of the conversation
    greeting = Msg(
        name="user",
        content="Now you three count off each other from 1, and just report the number without any other information.",
        role="user",
    )

    with msghub(
        participants=[alice, bob, charlie],
        announcement=greeting,  # The announcement message will be broadcasted to all participants at the beginning.
    ) as hub:
        # The first round of the conversation
        alice()
        bob()
        charlie()

        # We can manage the participants dynamically, e.g. delete an agent from the conversation.
        hub.delete(charlie)

        # Broadcast a message to all participants
        hub.broadcast(
            Msg(
                "user",
                "Charlie has left the conversation.",
                "user",
            ),
        )

        # The second round of the conversation
        alice()
        bob()
        charlie()





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Alice: 1
    Bob: 2
    Charlie: 3
    Alice: 4
    Bob: 5
    Charlie: 1




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 121-122

Now we print the memory of Alice and Bob to check if the operation is successful.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 122-131

.. code-block:: Python


    print("Memory of Alice:")
    for msg in alice.memory.get_memory():
        print(f"{msg.name}: {msg.content}")

    print("\nMemory of Charlie:")
    for msg in charlie.memory.get_memory():
        print(f"{msg.name}: {msg.content}")





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Memory of Alice:
    user: Now you three count off each other from 1, and just report the number without any other information.
    Alice: 1
    Bob: 2
    Charlie: 3
    user: Charlie has left the conversation.
    Alice: 4
    Bob: 5

    Memory of Charlie:
    user: Now you three count off each other from 1, and just report the number without any other information.
    Alice: 1
    Bob: 2
    Charlie: 3
    Charlie: 1




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 132-135

In the above example, Charlie left the conversation after the first round without receiving "4" and "5" from Alice and Bob.
Therefore, it reported "4" in the second round.
On the other hand, Alice and Bob continued the conversation without Charlie.
