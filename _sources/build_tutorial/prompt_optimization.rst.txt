System Prompt Optimization
============================

AgentScope implements a module for optimizing Agent System Prompts.

.. _system-prompt-generator:

System Prompt Generator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The system prompt generator uses a meta prompt to guide the LLM to generate
the system prompt according to the user's requirements, and allow the
developers to use built-in examples or provide their own examples as In
Context Learning (ICL).

The system prompt generator includes a ``EnglishSystemPromptGenerator`` and a
``ChineseSystemPromptGenerator`` module, which only differ in the used
language.

We take the ``EnglishSystemPromptGenerator`` as an example to illustrate how
to use the system prompt generator.

Initialization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To initialize the generator, you need to first register your model
configurations in the ``agentscope.init`` function.

.. code-block:: Python


    from agentscope.prompt import EnglishSystemPromptGenerator
    import agentscope

    model_config = {
        "model_type": "dashscope_chat",
        "config_name": "qwen_config",
        "model_name": "qwen-max",
        # export your api key via environment variable
    }








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 45-47

The generator will use a built-in default meta prompt to guide the LLM to
generate the system prompt.

.. code-block:: Python



    agentscope.init(
        model_configs=model_config,
    )

    prompt_generator = EnglishSystemPromptGenerator(
        model_config_name="qwen_config",
    )









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 59-70

Users are welcome to freely try different optimization methods. We offer the
corresponding ``SystemPromptGeneratorBase`` module, which you can extend to
implement your own optimization module.

Generation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Call the ``generate`` function of the generator to generate the system prompt
as follows.

You can input a requirement, or your system prompt to be optimized.

       - Create eye-catching titles and hashtags to increase visibility and engagement.
   
    2. **Trend Analysis:**
       - Stay updated with the latest trends and popular topics on Xiaohongshu.
       - Identify and leverage trending keywords, themes, and formats to enhance content relevance.
   
    3. **Audience Engagement:**
       - Engage with the community by responding to comments and messages.
       - Build and maintain a strong relationship with followers through regular interactions.

       - Use relevant tags, keywords, and descriptions to improve discoverability.
   
    5. **Analytics and Reporting:**
       - Monitor and analyze the performance of your posts using Xiaohongshu's analytics tools.
       - Provide insights and recommendations based on data to improve future content.

    ## Constraints
    - All content must comply with Xiaohongshu's community guidelines and terms of service.
    - Ensure that all promotional activities are transparent and ethical.
    - Avoid using copyrighted material without proper attribution or permission.
    - Maintain a consistent posting schedule to keep the audience engaged.
    - Focus on creating value for the audience rather than solely promoting products.

    ## Knowledge Base or Memory
    - Access to a database of previous successful marketing campaigns and their outcomes.
    - A library of book-related content, including reviews, summaries, and author interviews.
    - Historical data on user engagement and performance metrics.
    - Regular updates on Xiaohongshu's algorithm changes and best practices.

    ## Example Task
    Create a post to promote a new novel. The post should include:
    - An engaging title and a brief summary of the book.
    - A visually appealing image or video related to the book.
    - Relevant hashtags and tags to increase visibility.
    - A call-to-action encouraging readers to purchase the book or leave a comment.
    - A link to where the book can be purchased.
    ```

    This optimized system prompt provides a clear and detailed description of the agent's role, skills, and constraints, ensuring that the agent can effectively create and manage marketing content for books on the Xiaohongshu platform.

Generation with In Context Learning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

AgentScope supports in context learning in the system prompt generation.

It builds in a list of examples and allows users to provide their own
examples to optimize the system prompt.

To use examples, AgentScope provides the following parameters:

- ``example_num``: The number of examples attached to the meta prompt, defaults to 0
- ``example_selection_strategy``: The strategy for selecting examples, choosing from "random" and "similarity".
- ``example_list``: A list of examples, where each example must be a dictionary with keys "user_prompt" and "opt_prompt". If not specified, the built-in example list will be used.

Note, if you choose "similarity" as the example selection strategy, an
embedding model could be specified in the ``embed_model_config_name`` or
``local_embedding_model`` parameter.

Their differences are listed as follows:

- ``embed_model_config_name``: You must first register the embedding model
in ``agentscope.init`` and specify the model configuration name in this
parameter.
- ``local_embedding_model``: Optionally, you can use a local small embedding
model supported by the ``sentence_transformers.SentenceTransformer`` library.

AgentScope will use a default "sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2"
model if you do not specify the above parameters, which is small enough to
run in CPU.
